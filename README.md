# MobilePay-AppSwitch APIs
Technical documentation on how to interact with MobilePay AppSwitch APIs.

## REST APIs
The folder offers technical documentation on how to interact with the AppSwitch REST APIs.
Documentation on how to get onboarded as a user of the API can be found [here](https://github.com/MobilePayDev/MobilePay-Merchant-API-Security/blob/master/Merchant-onboarding.md) and documentation on how to send actual requests to the API can be found [here](https://github.com/MobilePayDev/MobilePay-Merchant-API-Security/blob/master/Merchant-request.md).
The MobilePay developer portal can be found [here](https://developer.mobeco.dk).

## SOAP APIs
_Please note that AppSwitch SOAP APIs are not available for new merchants. New merchants must instead use our REST APIs._

The folder contains relevant documentation and WSDL-files for merchants using the SOAP-based solution.
Please write to [help@mobilepay.dk](mailto://help@mobilepay.dk) for example code regarding PKI factory and SOAP library.

## AppSwitch best practice example
In order to ensure a smooth user experience, we recommend all merchants follow our best practice implementation example.
The guide will show how to implement MobilePay AppSwitch in a manner that is able to handle exceptions.
In short, the idea is to show merchants how we would like them to handle exceptions. The illustrations are responsive via links, clearly marked in red.
